Humidity,Climatic Conditions,Low humidity,"No fruits, small size, low output, etc",Negative impact on the development of the fruits,"Reguralry spraying the leafs, planting in high humidity area are the best option"
Soil Type,Soil Characteristics,Low humidity,Negatively affect root health,Negative impact on the development of the fruits,"Well-drained sandy-loam to clay-loam soils that are rich in organic matter, slightly sloping land tend to exhibit better performance"

Yield to low selling value","Maintaining a high level of humidity, store the fruit in sealed polyethylene film bags or plastic containers"
Browning,Post-harvest problems,"Dehydration, physical damage that occurs during handling, as well as enzymatic reactions, particularly those involving polyphenol oxidase",Browning of the fruit's peel and spines,"The fruit looks less attractive, rots quickly, and has a negative impact on fruit sales.","Various post-harvest treatments, such as soaking the fruit in a solution of sodium nitroprusside. Maintaining fruit quality, storing rambutan in a controlled atmosphere with elevated levels of carbon dioxide can also be effective in reducing color loss. Sell within 1 - 2 day after harvesting"

Storage life,Storage Conditions,"Temprature, humidity too high or low, ","Faster natural deterioration processes, color loss","Selling value drop, short shelf life","Maintain optimal temperature 8 to 15 degree celcius, high relative humidity of 90 to 95%. Under these conditions, the fruit can typically be stored for about 14 to 16 days. Used controlled athmospheres, with composition of 7 - 12% CO2, 3-5% O2, temperature of 10 degree celcius. Can help extend shelf life"
